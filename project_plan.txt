A landing page for a software company.
The project will be a landing page about the 
Spark. A software company that builds web applications for multiple
niches. The page content consists of appellative content to
sell solutions to multiple businesses and show more about Spark.
The reason is I started a new company with my friends called Spark,
however we don't have a website, I think that is the moment.
